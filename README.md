Website toolkit for Arkheim.


# Primary functionalities

## (Minor) Distance calculator
Have a simple distance calculator (that can actually just be brought up as a modal) to calculate the time it takes to travel. It should allow input for source, destination and WL speed. It should also have a selectable option for the distance penalties:
```
Added distance per mission type:
Goblin fort, relic = 0
Goblin tower raid, anvil attack (?) = 5
Support mission to towers = 10
Raiding towers = 16
Conquers / Destroy (portal) = 20
```

## Matchup planner
Have a simple drag-and-drop style matchup planner to plan which warlords will / should face which. The warlords can be added manually (Warlord, Total FS, and troop in each troop slots (maybe FS per troop slot?)) or they can be added trough a pasted screenshot where the user selects the area. The tool itself will not block any FS restrictions (it'll allow the player to put a less FS WL ahead of another one).

## (Future) Realm management
Manage your realm with accounts, donation tracking, announcements, and other sorts of tools.

## (Future) Battle planner
Have a battle planner with the ability to create a "strategy map" with points of interest and the ability to see the distance between them. Additionally, the map can be adjusted to a "real map" with the use of a screenshot and two points, and the "website objects" will align with everything - for better visualization.

## (Future) Combat simulator
The ability to simulate combat odds (given that there's some RNG regarding items).

## (Future) Share-able links
Be able to do joint battle planning trough a share-able link that will allow viewing in real time - permissions can be given for "spectator" and "planner".
